## Project Overview

At Skilharvest, we believe in the power of data analysis to drive informed decision-making.I analyzed the demographics of our data analysis class at Skilharvest,which consists of 43 students. The dataset comprises essential information such as student names,age,residences,occupations,education backgrounds,genders, and marital status.By analyzing these variables, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the demographics within the student cohort,identifying trends and patterns. In essence,this report provide insights into the demographics of our data analysis students, guiding our decision to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.

## Data Sources

We  utilized a google form. We created a google form containing questions about student demographics such as name,age,residence,occupation,education background,marital status and gender.We then shared the google form link with data analysis students, inviting rach students to fill out their details. Once we collected all the responses,we transferred the data to power BI.


## Tools
* Google form-Data Collection
* Power BI -Data Cleaning and Visualization


  ## Data Cleaning/Preparation
  * Handling missing values-We checked for any missing or incomplete information in the dataset and implemented strategies to handle them appropriately
  * Removing Duplicates-The duplicate in the dataset was removed to ensure each student's information is unique.
